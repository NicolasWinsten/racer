### Wikipedia Game

This is a toy project I made while learning Elm.

This game is a peer-to-peer ([PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)) version of the [WikiGame](https://www.thewikigame.com/) you can play with your friends.

Play the game [here](https://nicolaswinsten.github.io/racer).

If there's something not working or you want to tell me why my code is bad, please make an issue
